# Pokémon OOP Experiment

This repository contains an object-oriented programming (OOP) experiment where I play around with the [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). 
The goal is to explore different OOP concepts and integrate the Pokémon API to fetch data and model it in an object-oriented way.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3
- Composer v2
